The helm charts of the RADAR-base platform. Installation of these charts is best managed via [RADAR-Kubernetes](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Kubernetes). Use the releases in this repository by referencing helm repository `radar` with URL <https://radar-base.github.com/radar-helm-charts>.

## About

RADAR-base is an open-source platform designed to support remote clinical trials by collecting continuous data from wearables and mobile applications. RADAR-Kubernetes enables installing the RADAR-base platform onto Kubernetes clusters. RADAR-base platform can be used for wide range of use-cases. Depending on the use-case, the selection of applications need to be installed can vary. Please read the [component overview and breakdown](https://radar-base.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RAD/pages/2673967112/Component+overview+and+breakdown) to understand the role of each component and how components work together.

The radar-helm-charts setup uses [Helm 3](https://github.com/helm/helm) charts to package necessary Kubernetes resources for each component.

This documentation assumes familiarity with all referenced Kubernetes concepts, utilities, and procedures and familiarity with Helm charts.

## Prerequisites

The following tools should be installed in your local machine to install the RADAR-Kubernetes on your Kubernetes cluster.

| Component                                                                  | Description                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [helm 3](https://github.com/helm/helm#install)                             | Helm Charts are used to package Kubernetes resources for each component |
| kubernetes                                                                 | The charts support Kubernetes versions 1.19 up to 1.22.                 |
| [helm-docs v1.8.1.](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs/releases/v1.8.1) | README generator for each chart.                                        |

Installation of these charts is best managed via [RADAR-Kubernetes](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Kubernetes).

## Usage

The radar-helm-charts Github project publishes a Helm repository `radar` with URL <https://radar-base.github.com/radar-helm-charts>. Any time a commit to the `main` branch is made that modified one of the helm charts, a new Github release is created for that chart. It is also published to the Helm repository. For that reason, ensure that the `Chart.yaml` file of the respective Helm chart is up to date for any commit made to `main`. In general, the `main` branch should only be updated via Github pull requests.

Before making a PR back to the `main`, ensure that the README of the chart is up to date using the command:

```
helm-docs -s file --template-files=charts/_templates.gotmpl --template-files=DOCS.md.gotmpl --template-files=README.md.gotmpl --chart-search-root=charts
```

or, when using Docker:

```
HELMDOCS_IMAGE=jnorwood/helm-docs:v1.8.1
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/helm-docs" $HELMDOCS_IMAGE -s file --template-files=charts/_templates.gotmpl --template-files=DOCS.md.gotmpl --template-files=README.md.gotmpl --chart-search-root=charts
```

For general usage and instructions view the [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) README. Below is a short summary.

In each chart directory use the following files to define what the README contents should be.

1. In `README.md.gotmpl` define which sections should be printed to README, with syntax

   ```
   {{ template "chart.header" . }}
   {{ template "chart.deprecationWarning" . }}

   {{ template "chart.badgesSection" . }}

   {{ template "chart.description" . }}

   {{ template "chart.homepageLine" . }}

   {{ template "chart.maintainersSection" . }}

   {{ template "chart.sourcesSection" . }}

   {{ template "common.prerequisites" . }}

   {{ template "chart.requirementsSection" . }}

   {{ template "chart.valuesSection" . }}
   ```

2. In `DOCS.md.gotmpl`, define any sections not part of helm-docs:

   ```
   {{ define "mychart.usageSection" -}}
   {{- end }}
   ```

3. In `Chart.yaml` define as many metadata fields as possible, including at least the description, homepage, maintainer, sources, and requirements.
4. In the `values.yaml` file, put a comment line before each variable with two dashes `--`. Any text after the two dashes will be used as documentation for that variable.

## Updating external charts
External charts can be updated by running `make update-<chart-name>`. At the moment there are a few manual steps are needed which should be automated.
The external charts that have a depedency need manual steps:
- The external dependency should be mirrored in the this repository with `helm pull` commands that are in the `Makefile`, make sure the mirrored version is same as the one specified in the `Chart.yaml`.
- The external dependency should be relased on the main branch first so there will be a valid release of it in our chart repository.
- In the `Chart.yaml` the repository should be changd to `https://radar-base.github.io/radar-helm-charts`.
- The `Chart.lock` file should be removed and then run `helm dependency build` to recreate the file with new repository URL and remove any `.tgz` files that gets created.

### kube-prometheus-stack
For this chart, `Chart.yaml` needs to be updated to the latest version, remove `Chart.lock` and run `helm dependency build`. Make sure to copy the CRDs from
https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/charts/crds/crds
to 
https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Kubernetes/blob/main/etc/kube-prometheus-stack/files/crds.yaml
